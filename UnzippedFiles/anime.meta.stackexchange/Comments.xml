The crappiness of id requests is a combination of immature people in our community and the qualities of the question type that make it attractive to those people.

Then a bunch of kids come in and start yelling and screaming and hooting and carrying on and making faces at the monkeys. We can do two things: kick out the kids, or get rid of the monkeys."
